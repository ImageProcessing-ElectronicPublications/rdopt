RD-OPT ver2.0 has changed from ver1.0, in the following ways:
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Bits per pixel (bpp) reported for images with more than
   one plane used to be
     total # of bits / (sum of # pixels in all planes)
   It still is the same, but now you can specify the option
     -bppplane n
   which would make the denominator the # of pixels in plane n.
   For example, for RGB images converted to YCrCb and subsampled
   in Cr and Cb, you can specify "-bppplane 0" to get the bpp
   as (#bits/(width x height)).
   ** "-bppplane 0" should probably be used always, as that is
      the conventional meaning of "bits-per-pixel"

2. Default DC clamp used to be 12, it is 255 now

3. Weighted PSNR: there was a bug which has been removed.
   Also, the coefficient  weights can be different in different
   units. So the option is now set as
     -weights n <weights_file>
   where n is the unit number

4. Unit weights: each unit can be weighed differently for
   calculating the average distortion using the option
     -pweights w0[,w1,..]

5. Optimization method: Used to be dynamic programming, which is
   still the default, but you can set it to lagrangian by
   specifying
     -method lagrangian
   Lagrangian will usually be faster, except for very high values
   in the -thresh option (see below). The "-bppscale" and
   "-bppmax" options will be ignored if the method is lagrangian.

6. Command interface:
     see the file BETTER_README.. essentially the same as before,
     but you can now compress from the command line if you have
     IJG's cjpeg. You can also set corrections to reported bpp
     using the actual bpp if you have cjpeg.

7. Thresholding:
     The main improvement: global zeroing-off levels for DCT
     coefficients can be determined, for better R-D performance.
     Use the option
       -thresh <tmax>
     This will generate thresholding tables for DCT coeffs, The
     higher the value of tmax, the greater the span of thresholds
     tried. All thresholds in the range [q/2 .. (q+tmax)/2] will
     be tried at every qtable entry q, in steps of 0.5
     See BETTER_README for details.

8. Bpp correction: there are two ways to specify this. You can
     use the "-correct <cbpp>" option, and/or issue any number
     of "correct <cbpp>" commands at the command interface. In
     either case, IJG's cjpeg will be used to compress the image 
     using the qtable(s) found for the rate <cbpp>, and subsequently
     reported bpp's will be correceted by the difference between
     the actual bpp and <cbpp>.

9. Plot: you can specify -pbppmax to set the max bpp that will
    be used for -plot. Default is 1.0.

10. -dcdpcm option: previously, by default an approximation of DPCM
   coding was used to estimate entropy of quantized and DPCM-coded
   DC coeffs. It is turned off be default now, but you can turn it
   on with this option. Without -dcdpcm, the distortion estimate is
   slightly more accurate, but it is not clear whether the rate 
   estimate is more or less accurate. In any case, the difference
   is usually so small that this can be swept under the rug.
